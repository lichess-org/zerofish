# WTF is this

Just a toolkit to construct chess bots in the browser. You get stockfish classical and lc0.
LC0 uses CPU (OpenBLAS/eigen) so only tiny weights can be used.

For example, go nodes 1 such as https://maiachess.com/ or those with low block/filter sizes like https://github.com/dkappe/leela-chess-weights/wiki/Bad-Gyal
